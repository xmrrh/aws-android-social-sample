AWS provides API services for AI features, including translations for various languages. In this lab, we will use AWS Amplify with these serviceless (Serverless) environments to build a social mobile app based on Android native. To do this, we use features such as user authentication (Cognito) and Graphql (Appsync). Created apps can be tested in the cloud through AWS Device Farm. Additionally, take advantage of the ability to collect and analyze user events using AmazonPinpoint.
